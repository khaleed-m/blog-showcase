    "content": "# Building Scalable Web Applications with Next.js\n\nNext.js has revolutionized the way we build React applications by providing a comprehensive framework that handles routing, server-side rendering, and optimization out of the box.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Improve SEO and initial page load times\n- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-render pages at build time\n- **API Routes**: Build full-stack applications with built-in API support\n- **Automatic Code Splitting**: Load only what's needed for each page\n\n## Getting Started\n\n```bash\nnpx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript --tailwind\ncd my-app\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nThis creates a new Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS configured.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. Use TypeScript for better development experience\n2. Implement proper error boundaries\n3. Optimize images with next/image\n4. Use dynamic imports for code splitting\n\nNext.js continues to evolve with features like the App Router, making it an excellent choice for modern web development.",

    "content": "# Modern CSS Techniques for Better UX\n\nCSS has evolved tremendously, offering powerful features that can create stunning user experiences without JavaScript.\n\n## CSS Grid and Flexbox\n\nThese layout systems provide unprecedented control over page layouts:\n\n```css\n.container {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));\n  gap: 2rem;\n}\n```\n\n## CSS Custom Properties\n\nVariables in CSS make theming and maintenance easier:\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --primary-color: #3b82f6;\n  --secondary-color: #8b5cf6;\n}\n\n.button {\n  background: var(--primary-color);\n}\n```\n\n## Advanced Animations\n\n- **CSS Transitions**: Smooth property changes\n- **Keyframe Animations**: Complex, multi-step animations\n- **Transform Functions**: 2D and 3D transformations\n\n## Container Queries\n\nResponsive design based on container size rather than viewport:\n\n```css\n@container (min-width: 400px) {\n  .card {\n    display: flex;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThese modern CSS features enable developers to create more engaging and responsive user interfaces.",
